IBM Domino Designer plugin to export custom control into an XPage Library

You can find document here: http://blogsocialcollaboration.asi.fr/2014/11/27/library-xpages-personnalisee-export-automatique-de-custom-control/

If you are not speaking french, then Google Translate is you friend ;)

FIXME:
- Does not work with Designer 8.5.3. Needs Designer 9.0.1
- Export the content of xsp files into the custom controls design definition
- The wizard should be able to generate a plugin that contains a template XPage Library.
